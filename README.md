Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.

We have an inventory management system in place that updates our inventory for us at the end
of every day. This app represents a portion of our system that receives a list of items in our inventory and updates them as appropriate for each item.

## We have recently signed a supplier for a new item. Please implement the following:

  - "*Conjured Mana Cake*": **quality** degrades by 2 per day before the **days remaining**
    date has passed and by 4 after. Its **days remaining** decreases by one every day. Its quality can never decrease to less than 0.

## The tests work and are fully comprehensive. Use them to your advantage!

Remember, this app is just a piece of a greater whole, so respect the contract defined in the tests.
You may add tests, but you should not change the existing tests.
